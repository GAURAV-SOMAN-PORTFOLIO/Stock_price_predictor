# Stock_price_predictor
Stock price predictor is a data science project that takes in the different parameters of stock prices such as open value , highest and lowest volume and the volume of the stock to predict its closing price . This project compares two different approaches for prediction of the closing price . 
The two methods we use for predictions are
i) Machine Learning method 
ii) Neural Network method . 
The first step i.e of data cleaning and processing remains the same for both the methods . In the first method we are going to use the Linear Regression model from scikit-learn library .
